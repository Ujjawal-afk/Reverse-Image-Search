# Reverse-Image-Search
This is the first iteration of Reverse Image search using tensorflow and streamlit,
I also tried to deploy it using nginx was successfull but it was kind of slow.
In total streamlit is a bit slow so I am searching how to implement in a different way maybe plotly-dash

Further iteration may contain the use of more interactive web app and steps to deploy it on heroku, along with involvement of ANNOY from spotify.
